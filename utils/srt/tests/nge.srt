1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:08,200
I express my gratitude to the staff,
cast, friends, and the five women who brought this picture to the finale again.
Thank you very much ... Anno Hideaki

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,970
Adam is with me now.

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,060
This is the only way
to see Yui again.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,970
The forbidden unification
between Adam and Lillith.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,950
We're running
out of time.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,750
Your AT Field isn't
able to hold your shape.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,610
Let's begin, Rei.

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,200
Pull down your AT Field,
the wall in your heart.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,500
Fill the missing part of the heart
by abandoning meaningless bodies...

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,520
...and combine everyone's
soul into one.

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,780
And I'll go to the
place where Yui is.

12
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,600
Episode 26' :

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,200
True Heart For You

14
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,050
Asuka...

15
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,990
Ikari...

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,600
An object's falling fast
from the outer atmosphere.

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,660
Say what ?!

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,590
No, it's the
Longinus Lance...

19
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,180
Finally, our wish
will come true.

20
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,190
The original Longinus Lance
has returned to us.

21
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,950
We're short of the number,
but it can't be helped.

22
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,420
Return the Eva series
to its original form.

23
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,940
The true form which
brings us the revelation.

24
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,950
Return the people to their true form through the equal means of prayer and death.

25
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,100
It leads us to a
tranquillity of the mind.

26
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,540
Let's begin
the ceremony

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,410
Eva Unit 01's
been captured !

28
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,770
Altitude, 12000,
and climbing !

29
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,800
Seele is going to use
Unit 01 as a medium.

30
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,430
The holy root has been
implanted in Eva Unit 01.

31
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,360
Now is the time to resurrect
the Tree of Life.

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,150
Our servant,
the Eva series...

33
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,180
...exists for
this moment.

34
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,600
The Eva series have
released their S2 organs !

35
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,560
The dimensional graph has reversed and is showing negative values !

36
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,040
Impossible to observe !
It can't be expressed by numbers !

37
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,650
Anti-AT Field...?

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,570
This entire phenomenon is
exactly like 15 years ago.

39
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,490
Is this the sign
of the Third Impact ?

40
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,420
The S2 organ has
reached its peak !

41
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,950
Unable to maintain
the molecular bonding !

42
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,060
Our mission
has failed.

43
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,350
Direct hit !

44
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,250
The sedimentary
layer has melted !

45
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,480
The secondary shock is excavating near headquarters, exposing the outer shell !

46
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,350
It's only a
physical shock !

47
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,490
We can hold out by
maximizing the absorber !

48
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,990
To symbolize
eternal time...

49
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,790
...use red soil
for purification.

50
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,020
Firstly, change
the Geo Front...

51
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,820
...to its original form.

52
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:02,450
The black moon is the egg cell of Lillith,
the source of humanity and all life.

53
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,100
I don't want to
return to the shell.

54
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,180
But it's up
to Lillith.

55
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,190
It has begun.

56
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,550
Now, Rei...

57
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,020
...guide me to the
place where Yui is.

58
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,350
This can't be...

59
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,630
I'm not your puppet.

60
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,060
Why...

61
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,130
I'm not you.

62
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,680
Rei ?!

63
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,800
Please, wait, Rei.

64
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,850
No.

65
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,140
Ikari is calling.

66
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,010
Rei...

67
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,010
I'm back.

68
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,900
``Welcome home''

69
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,240
Rei...

70
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,780
An unknown high-energy source is approaching from Terminal Dogma !

71
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,550
AT Field detected !

72
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,910
The pattern
is Blue !

73
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,500
Could that be an Angel...?!

74
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,100
No, it's not !

75
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,490
It's a woman !
A human !

76
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,650
No !

77
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,730
No !

78
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,700
Dammit...

79
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,000
...dammit...

80
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,900
...dammit...

81
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,750
...dammit...!

82
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,330
Ayanami...

83
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,950
...Rei...

84
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,770
By using the incomplete soul of Evangelion Unit 01's pilot...

85
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,530
...we'll complement
the soul of humanity.

86
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,920
It's the third time
of the return.

87
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,680
The AT Fields of the Eva series are resonanting with each other !

88
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,350
It's getting stronger !

89
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,780
They've started to
unite with Rei.

90
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,250
Psychological
signal is down !

91
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,550
Destrude is dissolving !

92
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,090
The pilot's soul won't be able to take it any more.

93
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,550
No more...

94
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,700
No...

95
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,050
No...

96
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,950
No...

97
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
No...

98
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,800
No...

99
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,750
No, no,
no, no...

100
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,190
You're giving up ?

101
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,380
You're there, Kaworu.

102
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,060
Solenoid graph
has reversed !

103
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,260
The boundary of
self is weakening.

104
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,250
The AT Field is
changing to red !

105
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,250
The seed of life
the Angel has...

106
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,930
...and the seed of
wisdom the human has...

107
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,350
Now that Eva Unit 01 has
acquired both of them...

108
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,760
...it is equal to God.

109
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,420
And now, it's changing itself to the Tree of Life, the source of all living beings.

110
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,740
Will it be an ark to save humanity from the nihil of the Third Impact...

111
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,940
...or become a demon
to annihilate humanity ?

112
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,100
Our future is up
to Ikari's son.

113
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,370
We've done the right
thing, haven't we ?

114
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,410
How would I know ?

115
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,950
This Rei is
from your soul.

116
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,350
It's an embodiment
of your wish.

117
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,540
What do you wish ?

118
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,250
That's right.

119
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,670
It's like when I started
practicing the cello.

120
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,560
I thought there would be
something if I came here.

121
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,200
Why don't you
try, Shinji ?

122
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,170
Let's try hard to
finish the castle.

123
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,250
Okay.

124
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,250
Hey, Mom's here !

125
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,150
I've gotta go !
Bye !

126
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,220
Mama...

127
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,790
God dammit !

128
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,060
It drives me crazy
when I look at you !

129
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,550
Because I'm like you ?

130
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,700
Mama !

131
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,510
Mama...

132
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,520
Mama...

133
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,100
I failed to be Shinji's
mother after all.

134
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,100
Hey, come on.

135
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,000
Again ?

136
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,130
Aren't you going to see
your friend at school ?

137
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Oh, Ritsuko ?

138
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,600
I still have
some time.

139
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,670
It's been a week
idling at home.

140
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,200
I'm getting the
knack of it...

141
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,500
...so please...

142
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:28,530
I think I do this kind of stuff to find my own existence.

143
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,850
That's ridiculous !

144
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,060
It's just lonely adults
comforting each other !

145
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,760
At least your
body is needed.

146
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,030
I'm glad to feel
like I'm meaningful.

147
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,430
It's an easy way to know
that you're meaningful.

148
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,800
That's also part
of Misato...?

149
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,580
Yes, that's part of me.

150
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:58,160
You don't know the part of me, which is a reflection of overlapping souls.

151
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,410
The reality is painful,
but you have to bear with it.

152
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,350
Will I do what Misato
does when I grow up ?

153
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,010
Why don't we kiss ?

154
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,050
No.

155
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,440
Are you scared ?

156
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,650
It's too early
for kids.

157
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,940
Let's do it.

158
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,220
You don't
know anything !

159
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,450
Don't get close to me !

160
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,570
I do.

161
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,470
You don't,
you idiot !

162
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,550
Do you think you
understand me ?!

163
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,750
Do you think you
can save me ?!

164
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,170
That's nothing but
your conceited ego !

165
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,850
You will never understand !

166
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,280
How can I ?

167
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,980
You don't tell
me anything.

168
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,250
You don't tell me anything.
You don't say anything.

169
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,260
It's impossible
to understand !

170
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,250
Did you try to
understand, Ikari ?

171
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,150
I did.

172
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,950
You moron.

173
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,110
I know you're just
using me to comfort you.

174
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,900
Why don't you do it now,
like you always do ?

175
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,850
I'll be watching you.

176
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:08,430
If all of you can't be mine,
I don't want anything.

177
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,820
Then why don't you
be kind to me ?

178
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,520
I am.

179
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,870
You're lying !

180
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,670
You're fooling me
with your smile !

181
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,670
You want to
keep it unclear !

182
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,200
The truth will
hurt people.

183
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,640
It's awfully painful.

184
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,610
Uncertainties will corner me.

185
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,130
A temporary relief ?

186
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,990
If this situation persists
I'll be scared.

187
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,730
I don't know when
I'll be useless again !

188
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,250
I feel awkward !

189
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,410
I can't stay calm !

190
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,050
Let me hear
your voice !

191
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,850
Don't leave me alone !

192
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,060
Don't ignore me !

193
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,100
I want to be of help to you.
I want to stay with you all the time.

194
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,310
Then please don't
do anything.

195
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,750
Don't come close to me...

196
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,510
...because all you
can do is hurt me.

197
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,750
Asuka, help me !

198
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,180
Only you can do it.

199
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,600
You liar.

200
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,220
You don't care who...

201
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,150
...because Misato and the
First are harsh to you.

202
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,850
Your father and mother
are hard on you.

203
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,430
-You're trying to escape to me!
-Help me.

204
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,670
That's least
harmful to you !

205
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,210
Hey, please help me !

206
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,330
You've never loved
anyone seriously !

207
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,910
You care only
about yourself...

208
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,550
...but you can't
even like yourself !

209
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,850
How pitiful.

210
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,230
Help me.

211
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,200
Someone, please...

212
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,340
...please, help me.

213
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,250
Help me.

214
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,710
Help me.

215
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,700
Help me !

216
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,340
Don't leave me alone !

217
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,200
Don't desert me !

218
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,610
Don't kill me !

219
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,370
No.

220
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,020
No one understands me.

221
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,860
You didn't know anything.

222
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,630
I thought it was a wonderful world where no one would betray me.

223
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,280
You believed that the
others were just like you.

224
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,540
You betrayed me !
You trampled on my heart !

225
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,900
You misjudged yourself
from the start.

226
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,230
It was your imagination.

227
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,510
No one needs me,
so they should die.

228
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,290
Then what are
your hands for ?

229
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,670
No one cares about me, and nothing will change even if I live.

230
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,050
So, everyone should die.

231
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,210
Then what is
your heart for ?

232
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,750
It would be better
if I didn't exist...

233
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,520
...so I should die, too.

234
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,650
Then, what is the meaning
of your existence ?

235
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,550
Can I be here ?

236
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,250
( Silence )

237
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,050
The pilot's vital
signs are near zero !

238
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,550
The Eva series and the Geo Front have passed level E, and still ascending.

239
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,920
Current altitude is 220,000 km.
Entering level K.

240
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,450
All Eva units are intact !

241
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,900
The anti-AT Field from
Lillith is expanding !

242
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,050
It's going
to materialize !

243
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,970
The anti-AT Field has
passed the critical point !

244
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,100
No !

245
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,260
At this rate, it'll be impossible for any lifeform to maintain its shape !

246
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,280
The Room of Gauf
is opening.

247
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,200
The gate to the end and the beginning of the world is...

248
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,150
...finally opening.

249
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,330
The world is going to
be filled with sadness.

250
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,660
Emptiness is going
to surround people.

251
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,400
Loneliness is going to
fill the hearts of people.

252
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,150
Ikari, did you see
Yui after all?

253
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,750
The AT Fields...

254
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,400
...everyone's
AT Field is fading.

255
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,480
Is this the answer
I've been looking for ?

256
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,500
Senpai...

257
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,740
Maya...

258
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,150
Senpai !

259
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,350
Senpai !

260
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,200
Senpai !

261
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,050
Senpai !

262
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,250
The beginning and ending share the same moment.

263
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,300
Good.

264
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,400
Everything's going well.

265
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,090
I've been waiting
for this moment.

266
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,050
I can finally
see you, Yui.

267
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:19,730
If I stayed with him,
I'd only hurt Shinji.

268
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,300
So, it'd be
better to do nothing.

269
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,760
You were afraid of
Shinji, weren't you ?

270
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,760
I didn't believe that
someone could love me.

271
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,420
I don't deserve
it, either.

272
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,200
You were just
running away.

273
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,310
You rejected the world
before you got hurt.

274
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,920
The invisible and formless thing that exists between people...

275
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,950
You were afraid of it,
so you closed your mind.

276
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,310
So this is the price
I have to pay ?

277
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,380
I'm sorry, Shinji.

278
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,820
Ayanami Rei...

279
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,250
I hate you.

280
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,190
Why do you
think you can...?

281
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,250
Don't misunderstand me.

282
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,250
Why do you
think I love you ?

283
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,350
Don't get
into my life.

284
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,600
Get lost.

285
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,550
Please, don't call me any more.

286
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,850
You are persistent.

287
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,200
Don't get close to me.

288
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,660
You're the type I hate most.

289
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,450
I'm not going to
restore our relationship.

290
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,450
I hate you.

291
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,650
Don't come any closer.

292
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,670
Go away.

293
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,250
You coward.

294
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,190
If you're suffering so
much, you can quit.

295
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,250
If you hate it so much,
you can run away.

296
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,250
You want to feel
relief, don't you ?

297
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,550
You want peace,
don't you ?

298
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,310
You want to become
as one, don't you ?

299
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,260
You want to overlap the
bodies and souls, don't you ?

300
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,010
If it's you, I never
want to, even if I die.

301
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,140
Well...

302
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,510
What ?

303
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,610
What is a dream ?

304
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,950
Dream ?

305
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,750
Yes, a dream.

306
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,600
``Do you feel good ?''

307
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,820
I don't know.

308
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,430
I don't
understand reality.

309
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:05,050
You can't distinguish the border between someone's reality and your truth.

310
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,160
I don't know
where happiness is.

311
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:14,700
You only find happiness
in your dreams.

312
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,730
So, this isn't reality,
just an empty world.

313
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,900
Yes, it's a dream.

314
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,540
So, I don't exist here.

315
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:28,400
You recreated your own
world based on reality.

316
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,850
Is it wrong ?

317
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,610
You escaped to imagination,
and distorted the truth.

318
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,330
I can't have
my own dream ?

319
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,850
It's not a dream...

320
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,170
...but a substitute
for reality.

321
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,650
Then where's my dream ?

322
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,300
It's a continuation
of reality.

323
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,890
Where's my reality ?

324
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,260
It's where
the dream ends.

325
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,550
Ayanami...

326
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,080
Where am I ?

327
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,100
This is the
sea of LCL.

328
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,180
The sea of the source of life.

329
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,780
This is the world without
an AT Field, without shape.

330
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:58,550
It's a vague world where you don't know which part is you, and which part is another's.

331
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:03,750
It's a fragile world where your part has no end, and you can't find yourself.

332
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,020
Did I die ?

333
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,550
No, everything
has united.

334
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,250
This is the very
world you wished for.

335
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,150
But this
isn't right.

336
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,100
I don't think
it's right.

337
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,900
If you want others
to exist again...

338
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,570
...the walls of the heart
will separate all the people.

339
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,790
People might
hurt you again.

340
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,650
That's alright.

341
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,520
Thank you.

342
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,300
I think there was nothing but
bitter experiences back there.

343
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,970
So I think I was
right to run away.

344
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,520
But then there wasn't
anything good after I did.

345
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,000
Because I didn't exist...

346
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,390
It was like no one
has ever existed.

347
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:18,670
Are you alright if the
AT Field hurts you and others ?

348
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,450
I'm alright.

349
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,950
But who are you,
living within my heart ?

350
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:30,670
The hope that people can
understand each other.

351
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,770
Along with
the word, ``love.''

352
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,130
But it's
just imagination.

353
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,970
A selfish belief.

354
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,950
It's like a prayer.
It doesn't last forever.

355
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,990
I'll be betrayed
someday anyway.

356
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,650
I'll be deserted.

357
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,280
But I wanted to
see them again.

358
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,680
I believe that the feeling
I had at that moment was true.

359
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,850
Reality exists
beyond your sight.

360
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,950
And the dream exists
in our reality.

361
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,080
And the truth
is in our heart.

362
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,480
Human souls create
their own body.

363
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,550
And new imagination will change the shape and hearts of people.

364
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:31,840
Imagination and creative power will create the future for us, and the flow of time.

365
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,800
People won't change unless they try to change themselves.

366
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,430
So, if you are lost, you have to recover yourself...

367
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:48,920
...even if you don't know what to say,
even if you are deceived by what others say.

368
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:16,370
If their hearts can
create their own image...

369
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,130
...they will be able to
restore their human bodies.

370
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,570
It will be alright.

371
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:32,080
All lifeforms have the
power to restore themselves...

372
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,590
...and the wish to live.

373
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:40,440
If you decide to live,
anywhere can be heaven...

374
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,180
...because you're alive.

375
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:51,130
There will be chances
to be happy everywhere.

376
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,560
As long as the Sun, Moon,
and Earth exist...

377
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,140
...it will be alright.

378
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,550
Are you
alright, then ?

379
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,350
I still don't know
how I can be happy...

380
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:50,240
...but I'm here, and I will keep
wondering why I was born.

381
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,900
Then I'll simply discover things that are so common again and again...

382
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,270
...in order for
me to be myself.

383
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,420
But mother...

384
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,550
...what're you
going to do ?

385
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,200
A human will imitate
God and create Eva...

386
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,630
...is that your
true intention ?

387
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,100
Yes.

388
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,000
Humans can live only
on this planet...

389
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,170
...but Eva can
live forever...

390
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,950
...along with the heart
of the person inside it.

391
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:36,550
It will exist even if the Earth, Moon and the Sun are lost after 5 billion years.

392
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,550
Even if I live alone...

393
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:44,700
I will be lonely,
but as long as I live...

394
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,300
The sign that someone existed won't be forgotten.

395
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,820
Farewell, Mother.

396
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,570
I feel terrible.

397
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,900
The End
